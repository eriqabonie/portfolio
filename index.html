                <p>
                    I'm a Web Developer that enjoys building things. I'm currently learning some of the new technologies so I can build modern apps using the most up to date methods.

                    I started out learning HTML online way back in the day. I built my first website with HTML and inline styles. (lol....I know) 
                    Since then, I've learnt alot more and continue to learn constantly. 
                    I enjoy the fact that I can have an idea, take steps to build it out and bring it to life.
